      <p>&nbsp &nbsp 
      This application's purpose is oferring a most pleasant experience to users that are interested in 
      creating their own animations, for personal reasons or just for fun. 
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp &nbsp
      So, any user can create 2D graphical objects based on Bezier Curves. To create an object the user will be able to choose 
      the desired number of sides for the shape and the shape willl be generated automatically. After that the user can simply 
      shape them around as he wants. A new created and added object will have it's own layer of transparency so  the user can 
      have multiple objects and diferrent movements for his animation.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp &nbsp
      The user will then be able to modify the animation with multiple options.
      He can access those options trough the menu on the right.
      <br><br>
      Objects's properties mean: 
      <ul>
          <li>Size</li>
          <li>Position</li>
          <li>Color</li>
          <li>Transparency level</li>
          <li>Rotation degrees</li>
      </ul>
      Animation's properties mean: 
      <ul>
          <li>Choosing timing function type: ease-ing / linear</li>
          <li>Duration of the animation</li>
          <li>Relative rotation point for the object</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp &nbsp
      By default the animation will last 5 seconds. The user can select from the 
      progress bar a time and then apply new properties to the object so he can manipulate his animation as 
      he desires. The current layer's play can be started/paused using the button near the progress bar. The trash can 
      will, on click, delete the current layer from the animation. 
      More objects can be animated by adding a new layer with a new/an existing object and applying 
      new properties on that layer. <br> The user must first select the layer he wants to edit from
      the Layers tab on the right menu. If the user isn't sure about the animations he created,
      the Play Animation button from the menu will open a popup with the full animation as a preview. 
      If  the user doesn't like it he can edit the animation more and more until it's perfectly fit  to his imagination
      then export it in a zip into his computer(with the html + css for that animation).

          <a href="https://github.com/MariaM08/kanr-CLIW">KANR-GitHub</a><br>
          Managing git in our small team was easy. As we communicate a lot about our project
          having rules set for code managing wasn't neccessary. So changes were communicated verbally.
